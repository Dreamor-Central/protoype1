Return & Refund Policy

We want you to love your Vasavi experience! If something doesn’t work out, here’s how our Returns and Exchanges process works:
Returns
• You can return your purchase within 7 days of the purchase date.
• Returns will be processed as store credit once the returned product is inspected and approved.
Exchanges
• Exchanges are allowed within 15 days of the purchase date.
• You can exchange for a different size, style, or product of equivalent value.

How to Initiate a Return or Exchange

    Send us the product images
    Take clear photos of the product and share them with us via WhatsApp for verification.
    Verification process
    Our team will review the images to ensure the product meets the eligibility criteria (unused, in original condition, with tags intact).
    Ship the product back to us
    After approval, send the product to our provided address.
    Final confirmation
    Once we receive and inspect the product, we’ll process your request.
    o For returns, store credit will be issued to your account.
    o For exchanges, the replacement product will be dispatched.

Important Notes
• Products must be in their original, unused condition with all tags intact.
• Returns are only eligible for store credit, not refunds.
• Any shipping charges for returns or exchanges will be the customer’s responsibility.
We’re here to help! For any questions, feel free to reach out to us via WhatsApp or email.
